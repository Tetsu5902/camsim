# Empty lines and comment lines are ignored.
#
# Each remaining line defines one keyframe, consisting of time, position,
# rotation, and scale.
#
# The default values are time=0, position=0, rotation=0, scale=1.
#
# The time is given in seconds. Example 'time 1.0'.
#
# The position is given in meters, in one of the following three ways:
# - cartesian coordinates: x y z
#   Example 'pos:cart 1.0 2.0 3.0'.
# - cylindrical coordinates: r phi y (phi=0 is the negative z axis)
#   Example 'pos:cyl 1.0 30.0 0.0'.
# - spherical coordinates: r phi theta (phi=theta=0 is the neg. z axis)
#   Example 'pos:sph 1.0 30.0 15.0'.
#
# The rotation is given in one of the following three ways:
# - axis and angle: x y z alpha
#   Example: 'rot:axisangle 0 1 0 30'
# - direction: forward_x forward_y forward_z up_x up_y up_z
#   Example: 'rot:dir 1 0 0 0 1 0'
# - euler angles: pitch yaw roll
#   Example: 'rot:euler 10 20 10'
#
# The scale is given as factor for x, y, z. Example 'scale 1 1.5 2'.
#
# You can specify time, position, rotation, and scale multiple times
# for a single keyframe:
# - Times are added
# - Positions are added
# - Rotations are converted to quaternions and multiplied
# - Scale factors are multiplied
#

# The object moves from left to right at 5m distance to the origin,
# and it always looks away from the camera.
